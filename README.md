# 🩺 Breast Cancer Survival by Gender (NHS England Data)

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project explores gender disparities in **5-year net survival** for breast cancer using NHS England statistics (2016–2020). The goal was to build foundational skills in health data science by focusing on data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation.

---

## 💬 Key Insight  
- **Female 5-year net survival:** 85.9%  
- **Male 5-year net survival:** 83.8%

While the difference is small, it may reflect:  
- Later diagnosis in males  
- Lower awareness  
- Smaller sample size  

This highlights the importance of awareness campaigns targeted at men and tailored screening strategies.
