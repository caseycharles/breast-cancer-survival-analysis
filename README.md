🩺Health Disparities in Cancer Survival
5-year net survival for Breast Cancer by gender


🔍OBJECTIVE: to explore whether survival outcomes for breast cancer differ by gender using publicly available cancer survival data from NHS England (2016-2020).

The goal was to build foundational health data science skills focusing on data cleaning, simple visualisation and interpretation.

📊CHART:

🧾INSIGHT: Males with breast cancer have a 5-year net survival of 83.8%, compared to 85.9% in females. 

While the difference is small it may reflect later diagnosis in males due to low awareness, smaller sample size (fewer male cases) and potential biological variation.

This highlights the importance of awareness campaigns targeted towards men and the need for tailored screening and diagnostic support.
